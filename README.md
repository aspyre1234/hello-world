# hello-world
My first attempt at using GitHub

I am new to Git and GitHub. I am taking the Web Development course with The Odin Project and that is why I'm here to have a hand-on
experience. Although I have created this GitHub account months ago when I started the Web Development course on the Free Code Camp, however, for some reasons I was not able to continue the course but plan to do so soon.

I hope I get to finish both courses and go on to become a REAL Web Developer!
